Gitviewer

Gitviewer generates a static website showing all the git repositories on nightshift's internal server.

Current goals are to generate an index page which lists each repository by name, displays it's description as stated in the repository's description file, and gives the date it was last pushed to the server (by accessing the directory's mtime). Each project will get it's own page with further information, including a link to clone the repository should it not be on the workstation the user is on. This site will only be available to those who have access to nightshift's network.
NOTE: Even though the description file is automatically generated by git init, it is never commited or retrieved as part of a git clone operation. As such, you will need to edit this file yourself on the server that this script if running if you want any usable information in the location this script uses the file.

This is the text of the README file for the repository, if it exists. Not all developers create a readme file, and of the ones that do, they don't all handle it the same way.

Since we will be parsing this file into our pages, we will have to be very careful in out script to make sure we are able to handle all the ways we know of for developers to create their readme, and the way they name the file.

Most developers create the readme as plain text or using some flavor of markdown. Other developers will use an html partitial, with and without markdown. To avoid having to write our own parser, will will make use of the cmark package, in the shell version anyway. If, or when, we port to perl, we will have to look for a different solution.

Readme files can be very short, or very very long. Our template, and the script that uses it needs to be able to handle that.

Our templates do not currently follow semantic HTML and that will need to be fixed, befor we start the process of readying them for the script.
